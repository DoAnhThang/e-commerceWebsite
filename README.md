• **How to install and start this project (dev. version)**

(1) Open VS Code -> Open Root Folder.

(2) Open Terminal -> Run `cd backend`.

(3) Run `npm install --save concurrently`.

(4) Continue run `npm run install-all` -> `npm run start-all`.

(I have written more code in "backend/package.json", so only run terminal at backend, frontend side will be run at the same time.)
